# Predicting House Prices Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict real estate prices using various machine learning regression algorithms. The model is trained on historical property data to provide accurate and reliable price predictions for real estate properties. 

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to estimate house prices based on different factors such as location, size, features, and other relevant property attributes. The model performs predictions using machine learning techniques to help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Collected and cleaned data from relevant sources to create a well-structured dataset for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Engineered key features to enhance model performance and provide more accurate predictions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to understand the dataset, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implemented various regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict house prices.
- **Model Tuning**: Tuned hyperparameters and performed model evaluation to ensure optimal performance.
- **Scaling & Normalization**: Applied scaling and normalization techniques to improve model accuracy and reliability.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Developed a user-friendly interface to enable real-time house price predictions for end-users.
